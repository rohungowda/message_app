# Full-Stack Messaging Application with Real-Time Caching

## Overview

This project is a full-stack messaging application developed with Redis Cache. The application is designed to support real-time communication across different chat rooms, allowing multiple users to send messages and replies. The frontend is built with React, while the backend is powered by Node.js. The system is optimized for performance and security, featuring real-time caching, event handling, and secure session management.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Supports multiple chat rooms where users can send and receive messages and replies in real time.
- **Socket.io Integration**: Utilizes Socket.io to connect WebSockets for real-time communication, ensuring low-latency interactions between users.
- **Session Security**: Implements session state management using Redis, providing secure communication for both Express API and WebSocket layers.
- **Efficient Event Processing**: Uses Bull Job queue to handle various events like message loading, error management, socket connections, and system shutdown, ensuring smooth operation under different conditions.
- **Caching with Redis**: Implements real-time caching of messages using Redis, with a Time-to-Live (TTL) policy to manage the most recently used data. This caching strategy enhances performance by reducing database load while maintaining data accuracy.
- **Data Integrity**: Employs write-through caching to ensure synchronization between the Redis cache and MySQL database, preventing dirty writes and discrepancies.

## System Components

### Frontend
- **React**: The user interface is developed with React, providing a responsive and dynamic experience for users.
- **Chat Rooms**: Supports multiple chat rooms with real-time messaging capabilities.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: The backend is built with Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient server-side environment.
- **Express API**: The application uses Express to handle API requests, with session states stored in Redis for secure communication.

### Real-Time Communication
- **Socket.io**: Facilitates real-time WebSocket connections between users, enabling instant message delivery and receipt.
- **Redis for Session Management**: Manages user sessions and maintains security through Redis, ensuring that session states are securely stored and accessed.

### Event Processing
- **Bull Job Queue**: Handles various backend events, such as message processing, error handling, and system shutdown, ensuring the application remains responsive and resilient.

### Data Management
- **Redis Caching**: Caches messages with a TTL policy, managing the most recently used data for optimal performance.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores the actual message data, with a write-through caching strategy to ensure data consistency between the cache and the database.
